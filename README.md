# html_links_to_pdf

This is a tool to convert multiple texts (in html) on different pages into one combined text, as a pdf.

Languages:
	- BASH
	- C
	- Python

Dependency: 
	- https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf

P.S. -- My little blurb:
This tool can be useful for viewing the contents found in various links 
by scrolling through one pdf. My favorite pdf-viewing platforms are: Google 
Chrome (using the left- and right-arrows to quickly traverse pages), iBooks (for iOS: useful for viewing various pages of a pdf on one screen). I like these platforms for viewing text in a pdf because they are time-efficient.
